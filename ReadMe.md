# ReadMe Generator

## Description
Using command-prompt questions, create a smooth-looking ReadMe that includes your application name, description, installation instructions, usage, contribution rules, test instructions, optional licensing and your contact information. All linked nicely in a Table of Contents with your github profile and email linked directly in the file!

## Table of Contents
* [Installation](#installation)
* [Usage](#usage)
* [Testing](#testing)
* [Questions](#questions)
* [License](#license)

## Installation
